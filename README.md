# Architecture

In this full stack project, I used different types of frontend development, including Express HTML with JavaScript and an Angular-based single-page application (SPA). Express HTML and JavaScript offer basic rendering of pages on the server, allowing simple web page interactions. However, SPAs like Angular provide a richer, more dynamic user experience by updating the web content without refreshing the entire page. This creates smoother and faster user interactions, as the frontend can load only the necessary data from the backend.

The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database because it allows for flexible schema design and is well-suited for storing JSON-like data. This flexibility makes it easier to adapt to changes in the application requirements without the need for complex database migrations.

# Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that looks similar to JavaScript objects but is used primarily for data transmission between a client and server. It serves as the common language for data exchange, enabling the frontend and backend to communicate effectively. During the project, there were instances of refactoring to optimize functionality, such as breaking down components into reusable UI elements. This approach made the codebase cleaner, more maintainable, and allowed for consistent design across different parts of the application.

# Testing

Testing API methods and endpoints is crucial to ensure that data requests and responses work as intended. This involves validating that the frontend can successfully interact with the backend to fetch or update data. When testing endpoints with added security, such as authentication, it’s essential to simulate different user scenarios to verify access control and data protection. Understanding methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), securing endpoints, and testing for proper authorization ensures that the application remains robust and secure.

# Reflection

This course has helped me move closer to my professional goals by providing a deeper understanding of full stack development. I’ve learned how to integrate frontend and backend technologies effectively, gained hands-on experience with tools like Angular and MongoDB, and improved my skills in building dynamic web applications. These experiences make me a stronger candidate in the field, with the ability to deliver comprehensive, scalable web solutions.
